# Hi there ðŸ‘‹



## Introduction

As part of my professional development after my degree, I completed the School of Code full-stack Development course and the UX/UI Career accelerator at Experience Hause. Those experiences enhanced my problem-solving and team dynamics skills, providing a solid foundation in user-centred design methodologies and extending my coding skillset. As part of this, I worked within the Agile Kanban and Scrum framework in remote and office-based environments. My transferable skills include leadership, decision-making, team collaboration, and time management in a fast-paced and creative environment.
My hobbies reflect my career transition objectives. I have completed hundreds of courses on the LinkedIn learning platform and enjoy attending meetups and conferences. But when not at my desk, I still love sharing my Italian roots with friends, cooking creative dishes, and enjoying good company.
